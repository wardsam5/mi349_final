						<h2>About Me</h2>
						<p>I've been into computers and building computers since I was around 14 years old. I saved up money to buy my first pre built desktop computer when I was 14, and later upgraded the computer with parts I bought to make it faster. When I was around 17 years old, I bought all the parts to build my first new computer from scratch. I learned how annoying it was to build, and debug issues that prevented my computer from running correctly. My 2nd time building a new computer was when I got my first job when I was 19. I put a lot of money into the parts, and it was my first real computer I used to play games on my PC.</p>
						<h2>HTML sparked my love for Programming</h2>
						<p>I've had former experiences with coding in HTML. When I was in middle school, I was bored on my computer and came across web development. I was feeling creative, and wanted to do something new, so I went through some HTML tutorials, and learned the basics of creating a basic website. Learning to code in HTML led to me learning other languages such as Python and C++. With object oriented programming languages, I was able to see the infinite possibilities I could accomplish with just my computer. Web development has been a large part of my life, and helped me meet new friends that shared the same enthusiasm for creating. I've worked in groups, and made passion projects with people from all across the world, which ultimately helped me decide what I wanted to do with my life. I knew I wanted to be a programmer, and I knew that learning on my own was a great step to making programming a career. I did however lose my love for programming towards the end of high school, but eventually when I took my first programming class in college I fell in love with programming again. In conclusion, HTML acted as a catalyst for my love for programming which will be my lifelong career.</p>
